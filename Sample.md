Consider that you are working on an essay for school. Intially you will create a draft and save it in your system, now after completing the initial draft you made some changes like adding new information, deleted irrelevent information and corrected gramatical error in the file. After making all these changes you will save the document using save as and save it as draft 2. You might be thinking why should I replace the draft one with the updated draft?

The reason might be that the verbose in the initial draft might be better or the inofmation that you deleted might be important. So its better to save the file as draft two.  Now consider it is a folder with multiple files, It becomes complex to store multiple drafts of all the files in the folder, Now consider that its a group assignment and multiple people are working on the same files. Now it becomes even more complex.  After a while it becomes hard to figure out which file contains what information and what changes were made.

Now lets corelate this example for software development. Similar to draft one and draft two, for every application that is launched we have versioning. Versioning contains three major indicators called Major, Minor and patch, represented as `Major.Minor.Patch`.  This number doesnt represent the size of the software or application.

Lets consider an example, like your game character in call of duty, The
