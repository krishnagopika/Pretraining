# Git
## Versioning

Consider that you are working on an essay for a school project. Initially, you will create a draft one and save it in your system, and now after completing the initial draft, you made some changes like adding new information, deleting irrelevant information, and correcting grammatical errors in the file. After making all these changes, you will save the document using save as and save it as draft two.  

You might be thinking why should I replace the draft one with the updated draft? 

The reason might be that the verbose in the initial draft might be better or the information that you deleted might be important. So it's better to save the file as draft two. Now, consider it a folder with multiple files and it becomes complex to store multiple drafts of all the files in the folder.  

Now consider that it's a group assignment and multiple people are working on the same files. It becomes even more complex and after a while, it becomes hard to figure out which file contains what information and what changes were made. 

The drafts can be correlated to the updates in software development. As the number of updates grows, it becomes hard to classify and manage all the updates. On top of that the real-life development process includes collaboration.  

When multiple people work on the same project consisting of multiple files, it will lead to the following issues will arise: 

Storage: All the files that are created for all the changes will take up more storage. 

Tracking: Multiple changes made by multiple collaborators should be tracked. 

Maintenance: The changes if not tested properly may break the application and if that happens, the application must revert to its recent stable version. 

Security: Not everyone should be allowed to make changes to the application. 

To solve all the above problems and to add some additional functionalities, a version control system is used. 

## Version Control System

VVersion control systems are classified into two types. They are as follows: 

Centralized Distributed: 

Consider a scenario where one of your friends has a board game and for anyone to play that game, a specific friend has the access to it and all the other friends have to get access from that specific friend. This is an example of centralized VCS.  

Now consider a group of friends playing an online game. Instead of gathering at a single place, all the friends can connect and play from their homes. This is an example of distributed VCS. 

To put it in technical terms, centralized VCS has a single central copy of the project and programmers will access and commit their changes from that central copy. This arrangement is not preferred because if the central server fails, the entire project fails. A few examples of centralized VCS are CVS, Preforce and subversion.

In distributed VCS, the codebase maintained in the server is copied to every individual developer's system. Even when a single user loses the data, or a failure occurs in a single system, the code is preserved. A few examples of distributed VCS are GIT and Mercurial.

## Git installation and configuration

s explained, GIT is a free and open-source distributed version control system. It is used to handle small to large projects with speed and efficiency. 

To install GIT, please refer to [git download](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once the installation procedure is completed, and to check if GIT is installed in your system, run the following command in the command prompt in the case of windows or terminal in the case of macOS or Linux. 

```
 git --version
```

Once the git is installed, the output should be the git version installed in your system. 

GIT can be accessed using the command line, IDE and GUI.  

After installing Git, open Git bash and the following are the initial settings to be configured: 

1. Name 

2. Email 


### git config

Git config is used to configure the options like name, email etc. 

Step 1: To configure the name, run the following command with your user name. 

```
git config --global user.name "user name"
```

<i><b>Note: user name is entered in double quotes because the user name may contain space.  </b></i>

Step 2: To configure the email, run the following command with your email.


```
git config --global user.email user email
```

### Git bash workflow

![Git Workflow](images/GitWorkflow.PNG)

Following are the details about the Git workflow: 

**Working directory**: It represents the files and folders in your local system. 

**Staging**: Staging is an intermediate area between local files and the repository. The staging is used to check all the changes made and only the necessary changes are committed to the repository. 

**Repository (Local and Remote)**: GIT repository is the collection of all the files of the projects. The local repository is initialized in the local system and the remote repository is created in Git Hub, Git labs etc. 

## Basic git concepts

### git help

If you get stuck anywhere in git or if you need any information about any git command, git help provides detailed information about git commands. The following command is used for the above-mentioned: 

```
git command-name --help
```

To get the short description, run the following command:

```
git command-name --h
```

### Creating a Git repository

Step 1: Create a folder in your system dedicated to the git repository. The command used is,  

```
mkdir name
```

Step 2: Navigate to that directory using the command, 

```
cd directory-name
```

Step 3: To initialise the repository, enter the following command.

```
git init
```

- Once the repository is initialised `.git` file is created and it contains all the important information like git objects, hooks, HEAD and logs etc.
- `.git` file should not be edited because it might break the repository.
- Normally `.git` file is hidden to avoid editing.


### git add

Git add is used to add the changes made in the working directory to the staging area. The command used is, 

```
git add filename
```
TTo add multiple files that have the same extension, the following command is used. 

```
git add *.extention
```

The extension can be txt for text files, java for java files and so on. 
For recursively adding all the changes to all files, the following command is used. 
```
git add .
```

It's better to avoid `git add .` because a project contains huge files and it's not suggested to recursively add those files to the staging area.
<br>
To remove files from the staging area the following command is used.

```
git restore --staged file name
```

### git stash

`git statsh` is used to save all the stagged and unstagged changes. These changes can be omitted for commits until they are re-applied using `stash pop`. 

For better understanding, a stash is like a bucket in which all the changes are staked on top of each other. When `git statsh` is used, all the changes are stacked and saved in the bucket and with `stash pop`, the changes are brought to back from the bucket. 
Another alternative is ` stash apply`. Using this, the changes are saved in the stash and also applied to the working directory and staging area.



### git commit

Git commit is used to save the changes to the local repository. The following command is run to commit the changes. 

```
git commit -m "message"
```

Git commit contains the following information: 

1. Id: A unique SHA1 value will be generated automatically to uniquely identify the commit. 

2. Message: The message entered to describe the changes 

3. Date/time 

4. Author: the user name and user email configured in git. 

5. Complete snapshot of the project. 


### .gitignore

Once the git repository is initialised, it tracks all the files in the folder where the Git is initialised. Even though the files are not stagged, they can be tracked. Some files like user log files do not have to be tracked and added to the staging area and those files can be added to `.gitignore`.

To add a file to `.gitignore` enter the following command.

```
echo "file name">> .gitignore
```

<i><b>Note:</b>Once the files are stagged, they will not be ignored even if they are added to <code>.gitignore</code>. The stagged files should be un-stagged to ignore.</i>

### git status

Git status gives the state of the working directory and the staging area. Information about the current branch, stagged changes and un-stagged changes are displayed using git status.

```
git status
```

To get short status, run the following command

```
git status -s
```

### git diff

To view the changes made in the working directory and staging area, git diff is used. 
To view the stagged changes, run the following command, 
```
git diff --staged
```

To view un-stagged changes, run the following command. 

```
git diff
```

### git log

To get the history of all the commits, `git log` is used.  

Run the following command to get the history. 

```
git log
```

To get a one-line description of commits, run the following command. 

```
git log --oneline
```

<i><b>Note</b> <code>git log</code> lists the information of all the commits starting from the most recent commit. To get information from the initial to the most recent, <code>git log --reverse</code> can be used.</i>

### Creating a remote repository

Create a git hub account using the link [git hub](https://github.com/).
Once the account is created, to create a new repository refer to [git repository creation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)

### git clone

`git clone`  is used to create a copy of the existing repository. It can be a remote repository or a local repository. To create a copy of a remote repository, copy the repository link(HTTP or SSH) from the remote repository and run the following command. 
```
git clone repository-link
```

for additional information refer to [git hub clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### remote add

The `git remote add` command will create a new connection record to a remote repository. The following command is run to add and connect a remote git repository.

```
git remote add origin repository-link
```

For additional information refer to [git remote add](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories)


### git fetch

git fetch is used to download the contents from the remote repository.

```
git fetch
```

### git merge

git merge is used to merge the changes in the remote repository to the local repository. git merge is also used to integrate changes from another branch to the current branch. 

### git pull

git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge. All the remote changes are downloaded and merged with the local repository. In case of any conflicts, git merge will not be implemented. 

```
git pull
```

### git push

git push is used to upload the local repository content to the remote repository. After committing all the changes, the following command is implemented to push the changes to the remote repository. 

```
git push
```

### git branch and git checkout

A branch is an independent line of development in git.

![Git Branches](images/GitBranch.PNG)

In every project, there is a main/master branch. It is the initial branch created along with the git repository.  

In git workflow, a develop or dev branch is used to protect the information in the main branch. Along with main and dev branches, feature branches are created by users to work on the project. Feature branches are branched from dev branches and all the changes made by feature branches are incorporated into the main branch via the dev branch but never directly to the main branch. 

To create a branch, run the following command. 
```
git branch branch-name
```

To create a dev branch, `git branch dev` command is run. Feature branches are created from the dev branch and to create a branch from a specific branch the following command is used.

```
git branch branch-name from-branch
```
To create a feature branch `git branch feature dev` command is run.

`git checkout` is used to navigate between the git branches. The following command is used to checkout to a specific branch.

```
git checkout branch-name
```

For additional information, about git commands refer to [git commands](https://git-scm.com/docs)
