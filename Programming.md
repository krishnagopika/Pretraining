# Algorithm and Pseudocode

Programming is the representation of logic. A program contains a set of instructions that are implemented in our software applications.

Software applications are desined to solve the problems and to make our life easier. The most basic example can be a calculator, one can be fast in calculations but its redundant to expect a human to work all the time to perform calculation when it can be done easily using a program.

To solve a problem an approach is necessay. Algorithm is procedure for solving problems. It contains information about actions to be performed and the order in which are executed.

Before even starting code a programmer can come up with the algorithm using the informal language. For example if a person's age is above or equal to 18, they are eligibile to vote. The informal approch is

```
If age is greater then or equal to 18
     Print " Eligible to vote"
else
     Print "Not Eligible to vote"
```

This approach of using informal language to develop algoriths is called Pseudocode. Pseudo means fake so Pseducode translates to fakecode written in a form that humans can easily understand.

The difference between humans and computers is that computers are very rigid and even a small mistake or deviation will not give the desired results. Even in high-level programming languages like Java, Python, Java-Script and C/C++ etc the programmer should follow the syntax. When some one starts will programming its easy to start with pseudocode. Because in pseudocode one has the flexibilty to create their own rules insted of following the strict syntax rules like semicolon, curly braces etc.

## Pseudocode Standards

Psuedocode standards are the constructs used to represent the basic actions performed in a program.

Evary pseudocode starts with START and ends with END.

Before entering the constructs, one should know what are the common words used to reperesent basic actions in a program

Input: READ, OBTAIN, GET
Output: PRINT, DISPLAY, SHOW
Compute: COMPUTE, CALCULATE, DETERMINE
Initialize: SET, INIT
Add one: INCREMENT, BUMP

These are not fixed words but it is suggested to use them so that everyone can understand the pseudocode easily.

1. Sequence: One task is performed after other task in a linear progression.

Example: 

Consider a program to take input of two numbers and print the sum.

```
START
READ a,b
sum = a+b
Print sum
END
```
In the above statement line 2,3 and 4 are sequence statemnts.




2. IF-THEN-ELSE

Example:
3. Loop
  - WHILE
  Example:
  - FOR
  Example:
  - REPEAT-UNTIL
  Example:

4. CASE

Example:
 
In programming:

# Flow Chart



# Basic Programming

## Input

## Output

## Operators

## variables and methods and class

## If else and switch

## while for and do while
